# PiCrate
Create processing sketches in ruby on raspberry-pi and linux (this project is a parallel development of [propane][propane] targetting the raspberry-pi, but will initially be developed on a regular linux box). The aim is to produce a gem installable app that can be run with jruby, with minimal dependencies.
