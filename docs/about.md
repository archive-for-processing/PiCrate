PiCrate is an experimental ruby wrapper for processing for the raspberrypi (raspbian image), like the vanilla processing version this uses the 32 bit video drivers. I could be 64 bit drivers work, but is possible they don't play too well together (to use the 64 bit drivers uncomment them in Rakefile and gemspec and comment out the 32 bit drivers).
