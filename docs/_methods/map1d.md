### Name ###

`map1d` _NB: a different was used than vanilla processing because `map` has another meaning in ruby and we anticipate a possible `map2d` or even `map3d`_.

### Examples ###

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env jruby -w
require 'picrate'
class UsingMap1D < Processing::App
  def settings
    size(200, 200)
  end

  def setup
    sketch_title 'Using map1d'
    no_stroke
  end

  def draw
    background(204)
    x1 = map1d(mouse_x, (0..width), (50..150))
    ellipse(x1, 75, 50, 50)
    x2 = map1d(mouse_x, (0..width), (0..200))
    ellipse(x2, 125, 50, 50)
  end
end

UsingMap1D.new
```

### Description	###

Re-maps a number from one range to another.

As shown in the example, numbers outside of the range are not clamped to the minimum and maximum parameters values, because out-of-range values are often intentional and useful.

### Syntax ###

```ruby
map1d(value, (start1..stop1), (start2..stop2))
```

### Parameters ###

value	the incoming value to be converted

start1 lower bound of the value's current range

stop1	upper bound of the value's current range

start2	lower bound of the value's target range

stop2 upper bound of the value's target range

Returns	float
