The Processing module wraps all PiCrate sketches, and allows us to provide functionality like `library_loader`, but also to unobtrusively import vanilla processing jars. Other benefits are it provides a namespace, and allows us to alias vanilla processing variables and methods. The HelperMethods module is also included.
