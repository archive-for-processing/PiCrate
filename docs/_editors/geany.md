Geany is highly configurable, and we have created a `geany` project file `picrate.geany` and sketch template `picrate.rb` for you, thai get installed when you:-

```bash
picrate --install samples
```

#### Using picrate.rb template ####

![select picrate.rb]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/picrate_template.png)

Remember to give you sketch file a new name (PS: it's easy to create your own templates):-

![new with template]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/new_with_template.png)

Use `make` to check syntax and `run` to run sketch

See running sketch below:-

![geany]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/geany.png)
