# Using the ai4r gem in picrate.
# A simple example that demonstrates using
# a back-propagation neural network. Use the drop box menu to
# select a pre-built shape. To draw a test shape tick drawing check-box,
# release the mouse when drawing a discontinuous shape eg cross.
# Clear the sketch with clear button.
# Press evaluate and result is printed to the console....
